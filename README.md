# Treasure Hunt Algorithm üîê

## Description
This project explores the development of algorithms to help a treasure hunter collect the maximum value of objects in a grid-based building. Starting from the top-left corner and moving only down or right, the goal is to reach the bottom-right exit while collecting the most valuable objects. The project implements recursive and dynamic programming approaches to determine the optimal path and gain.

---

## Features
- **Recursive Approach**: Calculates maximum gain using recursive calls.
- **Dynamic Programming**: Optimizes calculations using a precomputed table for efficiency.
- **Bonus Variant**: Supports additional movement directions and constraints on the number of rooms visited.

---

## Requirements
- **C Compiler**: Any standard C compiler (e.g., GCC).
